Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields on top of Recurrent Neural Networks

This is the sample code for the paper "Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields on top of Recurrent Neural Networks",
which will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2018.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7, theano and lasagne

Usage:
Feature data and a sample base RNN model is applied.
You can directory run the main file RNN_SGCRF_train_end2end.py

Note:
The initial training of SGCRF is adapted from https://github.com/dswah/sgcrfpy.

If you use this code, please cite the paper "Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields on top of Recurrent Neural Networks".
